This system enables modular coordination between role-separated processes using language-based constraints and stateless schema propagation.

## Purpose

This repo serves as:
- A public authorship timestamp
- A secure claim of system originality
- A cryptographic anchor tied to a private implementation

No content from the system is included in this repo.
